### An Analysis on Kickstarter Campaigns
Assisting Louise with her crowdfunding campaign for her play by analyzing kickstarters to uncover trends.

#![Parent Category Statistics](path/to/Parent Category Statistics.png). 
*Based on this stacked bar graph, the United States has the highest number of successful kickstarters, compared to other countries, in multiple fields. These fields include "Film and Video", "Music", "Technology", and in Louise's case "Theater". Despite having the most success, the United States shares the title of having the most failed and canceled kickstarters across all fields. For example, The United States' theater kickstarters success rate is about 58% success rate due to the high reports of failures and cancellations. Due to those high numbers, I think that Great Britian would be a better alternative. Based on the chart, Great Britian's main field is in theater in which out of 359 endeavors, 258 of them have been successful (which is about 72% successful). As a result, based on the stacked bar chart and the success rate, I would recommend Louise's play to showcase in Great Britian.

#![Subcategory Statistics](path/to/Subcategory Statistics.png). 
*Even though the first stacked bar chat proves that Great Britian would be the best location to showcase this play, I think it is also important to look at the subcategory to reinforce this fact. The Subcategory stacked bar chat shows similar results to the first graph in which Great Britian shows the highest probability of success for theater (72%) due to thefact that thier success to failure ratio is much lower than that of the United States (58%). In total, Great Britian showcased 314 plays and 238 of them were successful, 6 went live, and 70 failed. The United States had 412 successful plays bt thye also had 250 failed plays and only 9 live plays. As stated previously, it is best to have Louise's play showcase in Great Britian in order to have a better chance of success.

#![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](path/to/Outcomes Based on Launch Date.png).
*When observing the ling graph along with the pivot table, there are clear spikes to show when plays had the most success. There are spikes during Febuary and May as well as a rise and plateau in October and November respectfully. Despite these rises and peaks, I think it would be best to have Louise's play "Fever" during the month of May. Even though February, October and November do show another rise, it is followed by more failures and as well as cacnelations. The month of February does have a small spike in success, but it is followed by failures and cancelations that almost measure up to the success' themselves when put together. Therefore, I think having the play in May can be much more beneficial and can have a higher chance of success.

#![Box and Whisker Plot](path/to/Box and Whisker Plot.png).
*As stated in Module 1.5.4, Louise's future endeavor (a musical) will cost about £4000. In the same module, I was asked to creat a box and whisker plot using only the goals and pledges of Great Britian. This was done by filtering the Kickstarter worksheet to show only musicals. I created the Box and Whisker Plot, one thing I noticed was that the goals were much higher than the pledged amount. The highest data shown for pledged only made it to the upper quartile. The majority of pledges stayed in the lower quartile which shows that the majority of pledges can only amount to a little less than £2000. Because of this, Louise's requested amount of £4000 is considered to be very high compared to the amount of money pledged. In order for Louaise's play to be successful, she will need to lower her goal to be about half of her origional goal (about £2000).
